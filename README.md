This notebook documents the data engineering efforts required to transform the raw GPS tracks collected by Daynamica into map-matched polylines that could be visualized in the [Transportation Happiness Map](https://maps.umn.edu/transportation-happiness/)

The script uses a local Docker instance of the Open Street Maps Routing Machine (OSRM) to match GPS points to the most plausible parts of the road network, given the location, previous and subsequent locations on the track, and mode of travel. It dumps the GeoJson output to a PostgreSQL instance so that it can be converted to an shapefile suitable for publishing to ArcGIS Online.
